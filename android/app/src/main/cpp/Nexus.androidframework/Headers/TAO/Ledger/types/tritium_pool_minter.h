     *
     * This class supports pool mining blocks on the Proof of Stake channel.
     *
     * It is implemented as a Singleton instance retrieved by calling GetInstance().
     *
     * Staking does not start, though, until Start() is called for the first time.
     * It requires single user mode, with a user account unlocked for staking before it will start successfully.
     *
     * A new trust account register must be created for the active user account signature chain and balance
     * sent to this account before it can successfully stake.
     *
     * The initial stake transaction for a new trust account is the Genesis transaction using OP::POOL_GENESIS
     * in the coinstake. Genesis commits the current available balance from the trust account to the stake balance.
     *
     * Accounts staking for Genesis cannot be the block finder for a pool stake block, so the minter will not attempt
     * to hash blocks until after the account has completed stake genesis. Before then, it will only submit a Genesis
     * coinstake to the stake pool.
     *
     * All subsequent stake transactions are Trust transactions and use OP::POOL_TRUST in the producer.
     * This operation will generete stake reward based on each individual account trust and stake balance, with a portion of
     * the overall reward going to the block finder.
     *
     * Pool staking also supports running in -client mode. In this mode, it will not hash blocks for either Genesis or Trust.
     * It will only create a coinstake and submit it to the pool to be mined by a full node that is pool staking.
     *
     * Committed stake may be changed by a StakeChange stored in the local database. Added stake is moved from the available
     * balance in the trust account to the committed stake balance upon successfully mining a stake block. Although the added
     * amount is not moved until a block is found, it is immediately included in stake minting calculations. Stake
     * removed (unstake) is moved from committed stake to available balance (with associated trust cost) upon successfully
     * mining a stake block. The unstake amount continues to be included in minting calculations until it is moved.
     *
     * Staking operations can be suspended by calling Stop() (for example, when the account is locked)
     * and restarted by calling Start() again.
